# Rothko-Freecodecamp
Rothko painting assignment Freecodecamp

All the projects that i have made on Freecodecamp will be uploaded to my github profile.

Yet some of these are not entirely semantically correct and not fully accesable.


To bypass this problem i will only upload projects after i corrected them semantically and also add accessibilty to these projects!
